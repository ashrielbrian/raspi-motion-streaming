# Intro

Web streaming & still image motion detection capture on the Raspberry Pi

# Usage
```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://www.piwheels.org/simple

```

where the `-i` flag is used to find pre-compiled wheels at the piwheels index (way faster installation on raspberry pi).
